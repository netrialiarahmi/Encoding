# Encoding
This GitHub repository contains various examples of encoding techniques that can be used in machine learning. Encoding is the process of transforming categorical data into numerical data that can be used by machine learning algorithms. This repository provides examples of popular encoding techniques such as one-hot encoding, label encoding, target encoding, and frequency encoding. Each example includes code snippets in Python using popular libraries such as Scikit-learn, Pandas, and Category Encoders. By exploring the examples in this repository, users can gain a better understanding of the different encoding techniques and choose the most suitable one for their specific use case.
